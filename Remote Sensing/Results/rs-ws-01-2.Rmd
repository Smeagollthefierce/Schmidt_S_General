## LIDAR derived data as raster pictures

Tasks of this group were to derive two kinds of raster pictures from the offered LIDAR datasets.

Task 1) Create a raster to demonstrate the height ranges between the lowest and highest LIDAR returns in each raster cell.

The result was aquired by creating a raster of the ground returns and one of the height returns, both with "LAS-Dataset to Raster", and then subtract the ground one from the height one, done with "Raster-Calculator".

Result:
![LIDAR_height_range_raster](D:\Schmidt_S_Github Repositories/Schmidt_S_Github_Repositories_General/Remote Sensing/Data/hight_range.JPG)

Task 2) Create a raster to demonstrate the number of LIDAR returns in each cell originating from all returns except those of the ground returns.

The result was created by using the "LAS-Dataset Statistics" operation.

Result:
![LIDAR_point_intensity_raster](D:\Schmidt_S_Github Repositories/Schmidt_S_Github_Repositories_General/Remote Sensing/Data/pointcloud.JPG)
